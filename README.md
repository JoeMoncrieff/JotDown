# JotDown

## About

Jot Down is a note taking app built with react and MongoDB. This project was mainly so I could dip my toes into the world of Javascript/React and building a backend. 
The client and server are currently run locally but could be extended to run online.

## Still to implement

* File titles
* Folders
* A better saving mechanism
